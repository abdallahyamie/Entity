# EntitySeg Toolbox: Towards precise and open-world image segmentation

EntitySeg is an open source toolbox which towards precise and open-world image segmentation on top of [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). All works related to image segmentation from our group are open-sourced here.

To date, EntitySeg implements the following algorthms:

* [Open-World Entity Segmentation](Entity/README.md)
* [High Quality Segmentation for Ultra High-resolution Images]() ---_code to be released_
* [pretraining]() ---_paper and code to be released_
* [Scale-aware Automatic Augmentation for Object Detection]() ---code to be merged


## Usage

Please refer to the README.md of each project. All projects shared the similar detectron2 base code and could support each other.
